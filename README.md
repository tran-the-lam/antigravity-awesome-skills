## New Here? Start Here!

If you searched for **Claude Code skills**, **Cursor skills**, **Codex CLI skills**, **Gemini CLI skills**, or **AI agent skills on GitHub**, this is the fastest path to installing a serious working library and using it the same day.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

**Antigravity Awesome Skills** (Release 9.1.0) is a large, installable skill library for AI coding assistants. It includes onboarding docs, bundles, workflows, generated catalogs, and a CLI installer so you can move from discovery to actual usage without manually stitching together dozens of repos.

AI agents are smart, but they still need **task-specific operating instructions**. Skills are focused markdown playbooks that teach an agent how to perform a workflow repeatedly and with better context, whether that means deployment, API design, testing, product strategy, SEO, or documentation.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (1 minute)

Install once; then use Starter Packs in [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to focus on your role.

1. **Install**:

   ```bash
   # Default: ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills (Antigravity global). Use --path for other locations.
   npx antigravity-awesome-skills
   ```
   The npm installer uses a shallow clone by default so first-run installs stay lighter than a full repository history checkout.
2. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   test -d ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && echo "Skills installed in ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills"
   ```
3. **Run your first skill**:

   > "Use **@brainstorming** to plan a SaaS MVP."
   >
4. **Pick a bundle**:

   - **Web Dev?** start with `Web Wizard`.
   - **Security?** start with `Security Engineer`.
   - **General use?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **NEW:** [**Complete Usage Guide - Read This First!**](docs/users/usage.md) (answers: "What do I do after installation?", "How do I execute skills?", "What should prompts look like?")

## Core Concepts

Before you compare bundles or start installing tool-specific paths, it helps to separate four ideas:

- **Skills**: reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks that teach an AI assistant how to execute a workflow well.
- **MCP tools**: integrations and external capabilities the assistant can call. Tools provide actions; skills provide operating instructions.
- **Plugins**: installable, marketplace-friendly distributions of the repository for Claude Code and Codex, including root plugins and curated bundle plugins.
- **Bundles**: curated recommendations for which skills to start with for a role or domain.
- **Workflows**: ordered execution playbooks that show how to combine multiple skills step by step.

If you want the clearest explanation of **skills vs MCP/tools**, start here:

- [Skills vs MCP Tools](docs/users/skills-vs-mcp-tools.md)
- [Plugins for Claude Code and Codex](docs/users/plugins.md)
- [Bundles](docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](docs/users/workflows.md)

## Integration Guides

If your real question is "how do I use Antigravity Awesome Skills with my tool?", use the matching guide:

- **[Claude Code](docs/users/claude-code-skills.md)**: install paths, starter prompts, plugin marketplace flow, and first-use guidance.
- **[Cursor](docs/users/cursor-skills.md)**: chat-first usage, frontend/full-stack starter skills, and practical prompts.
- **[Codex CLI](docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md)**: planning, implementation, debugging, testing, and review loops for local coding work.
- **[Gemini CLI](docs/users/gemini-cli-skills.md)**: broad engineering, agent systems, integrations, and AI workflow coverage.
- **[AI agent skills guide](docs/users/ai-agent-skills.md)**: how to evaluate this repo against broader or narrower alternatives.

## Quick FAQ

### What is Antigravity Awesome Skills?

It is an installable GitHub library of reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

### How do I install it?

Use `npx antigravity-awesome-skills`, or a tool-specific flag like `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--gemini`, or `--claude` when you want the installer to target a specific skills directory.

### What is the difference between skills and MCP tools?

Skills are reusable playbooks that tell an AI assistant how to execute a workflow. MCP tools expose external systems or actions the assistant can call. Skills guide behavior; MCP tools provide capabilities.

### What is the difference between bundles and workflows?

Bundles are curated sets of recommended skills. Workflows are ordered execution playbooks for concrete outcomes.

| **Codex CLI**   | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.codex/skills/`                                                        |
| **Kiro CLI**    | CLI  | `(Auto) Skills load on-demand`    | Global:`~/.kiro/skills/` · Workspace: `.kiro/skills/`                |
| **Kiro IDE**    | IDE  | `/skill-name or (Auto)`           | Global:`~/.kiro/skills/` · Workspace: `.kiro/skills/`                |
| **Antigravity** | IDE  | `(Agent Mode) Use skill...`       | Global:`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` · Workspace: `.agent/skills/` |
| **Cursor**      | IDE  | `@skill-name (in Chat)`           | `.cursor/skills/`                                                       |
| **Copilot**     | Ext  | `(Paste content manually)`        | N/A                                                                       |
| **OpenCode**    | CLI  | `opencode run @skill-name`        | `.agents/skills/`                                                       |
| **AdaL CLI**    | CLI  | `(Auto) Skills load on-demand`    | `.adal/skills/`                                                         |

> [!TIP]
> **Default installer path**: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills` (Antigravity global). Use `--path ~/.agent/skills` for workspace-specific install. For manual clone, `.agent/skills/` works as workspace path for Antigravity.
> **OpenCode Path Update**: opencode path is changed to `.agents/skills` for global skills. See [Place Files](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/#place-files) directive on OpenCode Docs.

> [!TIP]
> **Windows Users**: use the standard install commands. The legacy `core.symlinks=true` / Developer Mode workaround is no longer required for this repository.

## Installation

To use these skills with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex CLI**, **Kiro CLI**, **Kiro IDE**, **Cursor**, **Antigravity**, **OpenCode**, or **AdaL**:

### Option A: npx (recommended)

```bash
npx antigravity-awesome-skills
```

2. Verify the default install:

```bash
test -d ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && echo "Skills installed"
```

3. Use your first skill:

```text
Use @brainstorming to plan a SaaS MVP.
```

4. Browse starter collections in [`docs/users/bundles.md`](docs/users/bundles.md) and execution playbooks in [`docs/users/workflows.md`](docs/users/workflows.md).

### Option B: Claude Code plugin marketplace

If you use Claude Code and prefer the plugin marketplace flow, this repository now ships a root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```text
/plugin marketplace add sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
/plugin install antigravity-awesome-skills
```

This installs the same repository-backed skill library through Claude Code's plugin marketplace entrypoint.

The Claude plugin is a plugin-safe filtered distribution of the repo. Skills that still contain host-specific paths or undeclared setup remain in the repository, but are excluded from the plugin until they are hardened.

### Option C: Codex plugin marketplace metadata

If you use Codex and prefer a marketplace-style plugin source instead of copying skills into `.codex/skills/`, this repository now ships:

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

The Codex plugin points at the same curated `skills/` tree through a repo-local plugin entry, so the library can be exposed as an installable Codex plugin source without duplicating the catalog.

Bundle users can also install focused Claude Code and Codex bundle plugins from the generated marketplace metadata instead of taking the full library at once.

Like the Claude distribution, the Codex plugin only exposes plugin-safe skills. Repo-only skills are still available through clone or installer flows while they are being hardened for marketplace use.

## Plugins for Claude Code and Codex

Release `9.0.0` formalizes plugins as a first-class distribution model for this repository.

- The **full library install** remains the broadest path: use `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude` or `--codex` when you want the largest available catalog.
- The **root plugin** gives Claude Code or Codex a marketplace-friendly installable distribution of the repository.
- **Bundle plugins** give you narrower role-based installs such as `Essentials`, `Security Engineer`, or `Web Wizard`.
- Plugin distributions are intentionally **plugin-safe**. Skills that still depend on host-specific paths, undeclared setup, or extra hardening remain in the repository, but stay out of marketplace publication until they are ready.

## Best Skills By Tool

If you want a faster answer than "browse all 1,331+ skills", start with a tool-specific guide:

- **[Claude Code skills](docs/users/claude-code-skills.md)**: install paths, starter skills, prompt examples, and plugin marketplace flow.
- **[Cursor skills](docs/users/cursor-skills.md)**: best starter skills for `.cursor/skills/`, UI-heavy work, and pair-programming flows.
- **[Codex CLI skills](docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md)**: planning, implementation, debugging, and review skills for local coding loops.
- **[Gemini CLI skills](docs/users/gemini-cli-skills.md)**: starter stack for research, agent systems, integrations, and engineering workflows.
- **[AI agent skills guide](docs/users/ai-agent-skills.md)**: how to evaluate skill libraries, choose breadth vs curation, and pick the right starting point.

## Security Posture

These skills are continuously reviewed and hardened, but the collection is not "safe by default". They are instructions and examples that can include risky operations by design.

- Runtime hardening now protects the `/api/refresh-skills` mutation flow (method/host checks and optional token gate) before any repo mutation.
- The published GitHub Pages catalog runs in static public-catalog mode, so the maintainer-only `/api/refresh-skills` flow is hidden in production unless you are using the local Vite dev server with the explicit sync flag.
- Skill saves in the web UI are intentionally browser-local today. Optional Supabase configuration is read-only and should not be treated as a shared write path or authoritative leaderboard.
- Markdown rendering in the web app avoids raw HTML passthrough (`rehype-raw`) and follows safer defaults for skill content display.
- A repo-wide `SKILL.md` security scan checks for high-risk command patterns (for example `curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `irm|iex`, command-line token examples) with explicit allowlisting for deliberate exceptions.
- Pull requests that touch `SKILL.md` files now also run an automated `skill-review` GitHub Actions check, so contributors and maintainers get a second pass focused on skill structure and review quality.
- Maintainer-facing tooling has additional path/symlink checks and parser robustness guards for safer sync, index, and install operations.
- Security test coverage for endpoint authorization, rendering safety, and doc-risk patterns is part of the normal CI/release validation flow.

```

## Curated Collections

**Bundles** are curated groups of skills for a specific role or goal (for example: `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, `OSS Maintainer`).

They help you avoid picking through the full catalog one by one.

### ⚠️ Important: Bundles Are NOT Separate Installations!

**Common confusion:** "Do I need to install each bundle separately?"

**Answer: NO!** Here's what bundles actually are:

**What bundles ARE:**

- ✅ Recommended skill lists organized by role
- ✅ Curated starting points to help you decide what to use
- ✅ Time-saving shortcuts for discovering relevant skills

**What bundles are NOT:**

- ❌ Separate installations or downloads
- ❌ Different git commands
- ❌ Something most users need to activate during normal install

### How to use bundles:

1. **Install the repository once** (you already have all skills)
2. **Browse bundles** in [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to find your role
3. **Pick 3-5 skills** from that bundle to start using in your prompts
4. **Reference them in your conversations** with your AI (e.g., "Use @brainstorming...")

If Antigravity starts hitting context limits with too many active skills, the optional activation scripts in [`docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md`](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md) can materialize only the bundles or skill ids you want in the live Antigravity directory.

For detailed examples of how to actually use skills, see the [**Usage Guide**](docs/users/usage.md).

### Examples:

- Building a SaaS MVP: `Essentials` + `Full-Stack Developer` + `QA & Testing`.
- Hardening production: `Security Developer` + `DevOps & Cloud` + `Observability & Monitoring`.
- Shipping OSS changes: `Essentials` + `OSS Maintainer`.

## Antigravity Workflows

Bundles help you choose skills. Workflows help you execute them in order.

- Use bundles when you need curated recommendations by role.
- Use workflows when you need step-by-step execution for a concrete goal.

Start here:

- [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md): human-readable playbooks.
- [data/workflows.json](data/workflows.json): machine-readable workflow metadata.

Initial workflows include:

- Ship a SaaS MVP
- Security Audit for a Web App
- Build an AI Agent System
- QA and Browser Automation (with optional `@go-playwright` support for Go stacks)
- Design a DDD Core Domain

## Troubleshooting

### Windows install note

Use the normal install flow on Windows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

If you have an older clone created around the removed symlink workaround, reinstall into a fresh directory or rerun the `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` installer.

### Windows truncation or context crash loop

If Antigravity or a Jetski/Cortex-based host keeps reopening into a truncation error, use the dedicated recovery guide:

- [`docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md`](docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md)

That guide includes:

- backup paths before cleanup
- the storage folders that usually need to be cleared
- an optional batch helper adapted from [issue #274](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/issues/274)

### Linux and macOS agent overload

If Antigravity becomes unstable only when too many skills are active at once, use the cross-platform overload guide:

- [`docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md`](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md)

### Fixing agent overload (activation scripts)

If your agent is struggling with context window limits due to too many loaded skills, use the activation scripts. They keep the full library in a separate archive folder and only activate the bundles or skills you need into the live Antigravity skills directory.

**Important Usage Instructions:**

1. **First, manually close the repository** (e.g., exit your AI agent or close your IDE).
2. Open a terminal inside the folder where you cloned this repository (NOTE: repository has to be cloned).
3. Run the script located in the `scripts` folder.

macOS/Linux examples:

```bash
# Activate specific bundles
./scripts/activate-skills.sh "Web Wizard" "Integration & APIs"

# Activate literal skill ids
./scripts/activate-skills.sh brainstorming systematic-debugging

# Clear and reset (archives the live directory first)
./scripts/activate-skills.sh --clear
```

Windows examples:

```bat
:: Activate specific bundles
.\scripts\activate-skills.bat "Web Wizard" "Integration & APIs"

:: Clear and reset (removes all skills except the Essentials bundle)
.\scripts\activate-skills.bat --clear
```

## Web App

The web app is the fastest way to navigate a large repository like this.

**Run locally:**

```bash
npm run app:install
npm run app:dev
```

That will copy the generated skill index into `apps/web-app/public/skills.json`, mirror the current `skills/` tree into `apps/web-app/public/skills/`, and start the Vite development server.

On the hosted GitHub Pages site, the same app runs as a static public catalog: dev-only sync controls stay hidden there, and save/star actions remain local to the browser.

**Hosted online:** The same app is available at [https://sickn33.github.io/antigravity-awesome-skills/](https://sickn33.github.io/antigravity-awesome-skills/) and is deployed automatically on every push to `main`. To enable it once: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.

## Contributing

- Add new skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Follow the contributor guide in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Use the template in [`docs/contributors/skill-template.md`](docs/contributors/skill-template.md).
- Validate with `npm run validate` before opening a PR.
- Keep community PRs source-only: do not commit generated registry artifacts like `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, or `data/*.json`.
- If your PR changes `SKILL.md`, expect the automated `skill-review` check on GitHub in addition to the usual validation and security scans.
- If your PR changes skills or risky guidance, manual logic review is still required even when the automated checks are green.
